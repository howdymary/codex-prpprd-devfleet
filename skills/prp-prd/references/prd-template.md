## Problem Statement

{2-3 sentences: Who has what problem, and what's the cost of not solving it?}

## Evidence

- {User quote, data point, or observation that proves this problem exists}
- {Another piece of evidence}
- {If none: "Assumption - needs validation through [method]"}

## Proposed Solution

{One paragraph: What we're building and why this approach over alternatives}

## Key Hypothesis

We believe {capability} will {solve problem} for {users}.
We'll know we're right when {measurable outcome}.

## What We're NOT Building

- {Out of scope item 1} - {why}
- {Out of scope item 2} - {why}

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How Measured |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| {Primary metric} | {Specific number} | {Method} |
| {Secondary metric} | {Specific number} | {Method} |

## Open Questions

- [ ] {Unresolved question 1}
- [ ] {Unresolved question 2}

## Users & Context

**Primary User**
- **Who**: {Specific description}
- **Current behavior**: {What they do today}
- **Trigger**: {What moment triggers the need}
- **Success state**: {What "done" looks like}

**Job to Be Done**
When {situation}, I want to {motivation}, so I can {outcome}.

**Non-Users**
{Who this is NOT for and why}

## Implementation Phases

<!--
  STATUS: pending | in-progress | complete
  PARALLEL: phases that can run concurrently (e.g., "with 3" or "-")
  DEPENDS: phases that must complete first (e.g., "1, 2" or "-")
-->

| # | Phase | Description | Status | Parallel | Depends |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|----------|---------|
| 1 | {Phase name} | {What this phase delivers} | pending | - | - |
| 2 | {Phase name} | {What this phase delivers} | pending | - | 1 |
| 3 | {Phase name} | {What this phase delivers} | pending | with 4 | 2 |
| 4 | {Phase name} | {What this phase delivers} | pending | with 3 | 2 |
| 5 | {Phase name} | {What this phase delivers} | pending | - | 3, 4 |

### Phase Details

**Phase 1: {Name}**
- **Goal**: {What we're trying to achieve}
- **Scope**: {Bounded deliverables}
- **Success signal**: {How we know it's done}

{Continue for each phase...}
